# Mean planning
Python application to generate a random list of meals from an existing database

Meal planning is boring and repetitive but it is useful when you have a kid or when you would like to have a more sustainable lifestyle.  

As I wanted to learn Python, I built this application to plan meals for the week ahead, according to various criterias.
